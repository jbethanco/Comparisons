                // "button" is a bad var name. In this case it should be "buttonPressed" or in this case "textOfButtonPressed"
                // ðŸ¤® "disableButtons" and "dialogIsDisplayed" This is blatantly bad design.  They are always set the same set in tandem. We only need one. The original was dialogIsDisplayed. There was no reason to add a new one. Even the name is bad.
                    //
                    // SomeButton.disabled(disableButtons) <- doesn't have a why
                    // - does not read as well as:
                    // SomeButton.disabled(dialogIsDisplayed) <- The why is provided
                    //
                // ðŸ¤®  using a var to disable buttons and controls and various places around the app is really bizzare and adds so much code clutter. If your modal isn't modal, you are doing it wrong. The modal itself should handle blocking all user interaction behind it. Instead we have disableButtons appearing FIFTEEN Times in the code base now.
                
                // I added the "Old" suffixes below so this file could still work.
                // The names are bad even without that.
                // PBLModalDialog is not modal, and is not a dialog.
                // EventDialogContent is not a dialog. Event is in the name, so shouldn't be needed in the variable names in the init message. E.g.
                // EventDialogContent(eventName: $eventName, eventDate: $eventDate) { button in }
                // looks better as:
                // NewEventForm(event: $eventName, date: $eventDate) { buttonPressed in }
                // or perhaps:
                // AddEventForm(for: $eventName, on: $eventDate) { buttonPressed in }
                // This is suggestion on how to make this look better, not an endorsement of their use
                // The current way looks odd next to the Persistence controller method that calls it in another way.
                // PersistenceController.newEvent(name: eventName, date: eventDate)
