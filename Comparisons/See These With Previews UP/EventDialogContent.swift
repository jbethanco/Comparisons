struct EventDialogContentOld: PBLModalContent { //50
    // üí°No need to write a protocol to contain values that are already present. The use case for protocols is not this. If it was really necessary to pass, the values could be passed in an intializer. The sole purpose of the PBLModalContent protocol is to pass size. A better name might be  "SizeExposing" or "Measurable".  "PBLModalContent" doesn't describe the protocol or what it does. It's not modal and it's not content.
    
    // Let's take a look at a nicely named protocol from the STL "Comparable"
    
    struct AnExamplePerson: Comparable {
        
        static func < (lhs: EventDialogContentOld.AnExamplePerson, rhs: EventDialogContentOld.AnExamplePerson) -> Bool {
            guard lhs.lastName == rhs.lastName else { return lhs.lastName < rhs.lastName}
            return lhs.firstName <= rhs.firstName
        }
        
        var firstName = "Bob"
        var lastName = "Smith"
    }
    
    //Regardless of the above, the protocol is unecessary. SwiftUI views already have a readable size. Hard coding it is strange.
    
    let contentWidth: CGFloat = 280     // üí°To conform to the unecessary protocol REMOVE
    let contentHeight: CGFloat = 150    // üí°To conform to the unecessary protocol REMOVE
     
    @Binding var eventName: String  // üí°Needed for testing. Acceptable, needs a comment to let us know it will be replaced when Core Data implementation is in.
    @Binding var eventDate: Date    // Same
    
    var completion: (_ button: String) -> Void // üí°REMOVE
    // üí° Poor variable name. A button is a button. This is a string. What does it represent? It represents whether the user clicked Ok or Cancel. More concisely it represents whether the user wants to save the record or not. This shouldn't be a string at all. The desired effects have an enumerated usage. If this is only two values It should be a bool with a good name like "shouldSave." The call site for this is going to have no context. This should be named better. In a future case like this with more than two values then an enum with proper names should be used. (E.g. ".cancelPressed, .okPressed, .helpPressed") NEVER a string.
    
    //  üßë‚Äçüè´ Why don't we use strings in these cases? Cause they are easy to mess up. If I put "cancel" here and "Cancel" when checking at the call site, I get unexpected behavior, but the code "looks" correct and doesn't throw any errors. If I use a bool named "isCancelled" instead, then Xcode is going to yell at me if i type "iscancelled" instead of the correct name or if I type True instead of true.

It seems this was left in to pass a test. Are we passing the test? Yes. Are we providing any value by passing the test? No. We shouldn't be doing any UI Tests while actively updating the UI and not even having unit tests complete. The order should be 1. Unit Tests 2. Integration Tests 3. UI Tests. As we aren't doing TDD, our code base should be pretty well developed prior to writing any tests for things that haven't been locked down yet. We are just making extra work for ourselves until then.
